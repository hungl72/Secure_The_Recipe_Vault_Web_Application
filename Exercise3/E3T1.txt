# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack
UnauthorizedAccess:EC2/SSHBruteForce
Brute force attacks are used to gain unauthorized access to your instance by guessing the SSH password.
# Research the AWS Guard Duty documentation page and explain how GuardDuty may have detected this attack - i.e. what was its source of information.
AWS Guard Duty checks for the VPC flow logs, specific for port 22 in this case.
